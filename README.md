This is mostly an online backup for my Gameboy development scratch work. If I get to making an actual game it will likely go in another repository.

A lot of this information came from [Assembly Digest](http://assemblydigest.tumblr.com/tagged/gameboy), it's a decent place to start if you're looking to do this yourself.
